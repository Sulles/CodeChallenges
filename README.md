## Challenge #1 ##
Generate the shortest string with all permutations of a set of numbers
- For the set of numbers [1, 2], the shortest string that contains all permutations is "121", which has [1, 2] and [2, 1] in a string of length 3.

To submit your code for ranking, create a file with a function that has the same name as your file, that accepts a list of integer numbers as an argument, and returns it's best guess at the shortest string that contains all permutations.
